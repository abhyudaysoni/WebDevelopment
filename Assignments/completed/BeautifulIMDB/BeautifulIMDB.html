        <h2>Description</h2>
        This is the tale of Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), an ordinary eleven-year-old boy serving as a sort of
        slave
        for his aunt and uncle who learns that he is actually a wizard and has been invited to attend the Hogwarts
        School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry is snatched away from his mundane existence by Rubeus Hagrid
        (Robbie
        Coltrane), the groundskeeper for Hogwarts, and quickly thrown into a world completely foreign to both him
        and
        the viewer. Famous for an incident that happened at his birth, Harry makes friends easily at his new school.
        He
        soon finds, however, that the wizarding world is far more dangerous for him than he would have imagined, and
        he
        quickly learns that not all wizards are ones to be trusted.
